Data Interpretation:
We can clearly see from the plot generated by the data that two lines represent the numerical change of WO and NL beer consumption from 2006 to 2018. The increase in WO value was steady and significant, while the NL beer consumption fluctuated between 2007 and 2012, and then began to increase steadily and rapidly afterwards. So you can see that there is no direct correlation between the two values.
