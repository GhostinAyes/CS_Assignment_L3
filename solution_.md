Data Interpretation:

We can clearly see from the plot generated by the data that two lines represent the numerical change of WO and NL beer consumption from 2006 to 2018. The increase in higher-educated students was steady and significant, while the NL beer consumption fluctuated between 2007 and 2012, and then began to increase steadily afterwards. So you can see that there is no direct correlation between the two values. Although there is no direct correlation, the increase in the number of students in higher education reflects the increase in the number of migrants and younger consumers, which indirectly reflects the increase in the consumption of beer in the Netherlands. There is influence between WO and NL beer consumption. But it takes more research to figure out the specific correlation.
